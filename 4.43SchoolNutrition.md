Background

Living Sky School Division is committed to promoting and supporting healthy nutrition and healthy lifestyles for students and staff.  It is our goal to offer and serve healthy and nutritious foods in snack and lunch programs, vending machines, canteens, and any other school venue where food is served.


Procedures

1.	The development of a Nutrition Committee for each school is highly encouraged. The Committee should include representatives from the following, but not be limited to: parents, students, school administrators, teachers, and School Community Council.  The Nutrition Committee should meet to review each school’s nutrition practices at least once a year. 

2.	Schools should adhere to the process contained in the guidelines in “Nourishing Minds: Towards Comprehensive School Community Health: Nutrition Policy and Development in Saskatchewan Schools (2019). https://pubsaskdev.blob.core.windows.net/pubsask-prod/85696/Nourishing%252BMinds%252BEat%252BWell%252B-%252BLearn%252BWell%252B-%252BLive%252BWell%252B%2528updated%252Blinks%2529.pdf
This will allow schools to assess their status in terms of nutrition and to monitor their progress in implementing the guidelines. 

3.	Schools should adhere to the School Food Service Guideline, Technical Guideline Number 170 (April 2006).  This document includes the standards used by Public Health Inspectors when they inspect schools.  The guidelines refer both to the physical facility and the food handling practices in schools. 

4.	Nutritious foods should be competitively priced and appropriately promoted and advertised. 

5.	Schools should provide nutritious food and beverage options in vending machines and or canteens.  At least 75% of the choices should be nutritious.  For beverages, 75% of the selection should be 100% fruit juice, milk, or water or food and snacks at least 75% should be healthy and nutritious. Front panels on the vending machines should display non carbonated drinks or nutritious foods or healthy active living. 

6.	Fundraising that includes the sale of foods should include only nutritious food or snacks. 

7.	This procedure acknowledges the importance of staff acting as positive role models by such things as proper hand washing, nutritious eating habits, and using nutritious items as rewards in place of candy or junk food.

8.	All staff handling food should take the Safe Food Handlers Course.
