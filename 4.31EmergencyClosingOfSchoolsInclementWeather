Background

Every reasonable effort is to be made to hold school on the days stipulated in the annual school calendar.  When the weather poses a significant safety concern for the welfare of students, bus route service may be cancelled and/or schools may be closed.  The Division supports the decision of parents who choose not to send their children to school, or to ride a school bus, because of safety concerns during severe weather.


Procedures

1.	Schools are expected to remain open with staff in attendance even if a bus route, several routes, or all routes affecting the school, do not run, unless otherwise authorized by the Director.

2.	In the event of a school facility emergency which may be related or unrelated to weather conditions, a school closure may be announced.  This decision is made by the principal in consultation with the Director or designate.

3.	Each principal shall have a communication plan to inform parents, students, and staff in the event of a school closure.  The communication plan, which may include a fan out telephone system, must include provisions for communicating with those who are normally transported by school bus services and those who are not.  The communication plan shall describe a process for ensuring that public service messages about school closures are broadcast on local radio stations.  Principals are advised to communicate this administrative procedure to parents through the school handbook, newsletters, or announcements.

4.	The principal should make arrangements for the sheltering and supervision of students when parents cannot be informed of the school closure.
