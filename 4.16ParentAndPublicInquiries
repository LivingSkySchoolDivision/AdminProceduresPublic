Background

Living Sky School Division supports the rights of students, parents and members of the public to make inquiries into the conduct of operations of the Division.  In the interest of open communication, the Board believes that inquiries must first be directed to the staff members most directly involved in the operations in question.  The School Division is committed to ensuring that just and careful procedures for adjudicating and resolving complaints are in place.

Procedures

1.	In making a formal inquiry, the individual must be prepared to address his/her question or concern in person or in writing to the person or persons involved.

2.	If the individual feels a concern has not been adequately addressed by the person against whom the complaint has been lodged, the concern is to be taken to that person’s immediate supervisor.

3.	Upon receiving an inquiry, the Director or designate will ascertain if all local avenues for resolution have been considered.  If not, the individual will be advised to do so as the first means of achieving resolution.

4.	If all local avenues have been exhausted, the Director or designate will meet with the individual and school-based administrators or department managers, such as Facilities Manager or Transportation Manager, in an attempt to resolve the issue.

5.	Normally complaints concerning operations can be resolved with the parties involved.  On occasion the Director or a Board member may receive a request to intervene in school or department affairs.  In this event, the complaint will be resolved according to the following:
a.	The Director or designate will, as appropriate in the circumstance, refer a complaint or request for intervention to the school (usually through the principal) or department (usually through the manager), engage in mediation, or conduct an inquiry.
b.	The Director or designate will ensure, in cooperation with schools and departments, that parents or members of the public are provided with the opportunity to express their complaints and be heard fairly by school-based administrators and/or by Division administrators.
c.	The Board member, upon receiving an inquiry, will refer the parent or public member back to the school or department and will inform the Director of the question or complaint.  A complaint will be dealt with as outlined above.

6.	If resolution of an issue is not achieved at the Director level, the individual shall be advised of his/her right to a hearing by the Board.
