Background
School based or individual requests for software installation and/or the addition of hardware or peripherals must follow the procedures below in order to ensure the software is compatible with the technical systems and licensing is compliant.
Procedures
1.	Hardware
a)	Laptops, Chromebooks, and iPads are procured through a central tender with a one-year agreement.  
	Order: https://helpdesk.lskysd.ca

b)	To ensure devices can be supported, the makes and models of laptops and Chromebooks are limited.
c)	School-based orders must come through the help desk.
d)	School-based purchases will be removed from the school at the end of the replacement cycle.
e)	Copiers are preferred to printers due to the low total cost of ownership. If additional printing capacity is required, a device can be delivered.
f)	Projectors can be ordered from a list of pre-approved local vendors (Evolution, ProAV and Inland) or through national vendors (CDI, CDW, etc.) via the help desk – https://helpdesk.lskysd.ca.
g)	School mobile phones must be ordered through the help desk – https://helpdesk.lskysd.ca. Devices must be manually inventoried. Only the Technology Manager and Assistant Operation Manager have the authority to sign SaskTel contracts.
h)	When planning to purchase other equipment or technology that connects to the wireless network, contact the IT Department through the help desk – https://helpdesk.lskysd.ca.  

2.	Software
a)	Web-based
i)	Software accessible from a web browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.) may be licensed within the terms of Procedure 4.37 – Responsible Use and does not require additional software or plugins to work properly (i.e. old versions of Java or Adobe Flash).
ii)	Many web-based products support sign-in with Google or Microsoft integration. This method is highly encouraged.  Any accounts should be created using a @lskysd.ca email address and students under the age of 18 should not be accepting terms of services.

b)		iPad/Mac
i)	Paid apps may be purchase through App store using Volume Purchasing Program. VPP is cumbersome, so requests we will assist with these purchases at https://helpdesk.lskysd.ca.  Fortunately, most apps use a free/license pay model which sidesteps the issue.
ii)	Free apps are fine to use within the terms of Procedure 4.37 – Responsible Use with consideration for personal privacy protection.
		
c)	Windows Devices
i)	All software is deployed via the Software Installer tool on the Windows Desktop.
ii)	Additional software may be licensed by the school, provided the software passes compatibility testing. Software must comply within the terms of service and license agreements. Request via https://helpdesk.lskysd.ca.
