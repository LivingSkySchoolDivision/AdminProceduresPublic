Background

Although ensuring the safety and well-being of children is a responsibility shared by all members of the community, employees of Living Sky School Division have certain responsibilities and obligations placed upon them as a result of the nature of their tasks. Requirements concerning the welfare of children attending school are defined in The Saskatchewan Child Abuse Protocol 2014. The Division affirms that employees will be active partners with other agencies in supporting the needs of children.

The Legal Requirement to Report to Authorities:

The Child and Family Services Act requires that any Division employee who has reasonable suspicion grounds to believe that a child under the age of 16 (and in exceptional circumstances youth ages 16 and 17) is in need of protection as a result of parental abuse or neglect has the responsibility to report the information to an officer of social services or a police officer.

2.	The Emergency Protection of Victims of Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation Act requires any Division employee who has reasonable suspicion grounds to believe that a child under the age of 18 has been or is likely to be subjected to sexual abuse to report the information to an officer of social services or a police officer.
