Background

Living Sky School Division recognizes that students learn at different rates and that those rates can vary from year to year. Apart from academic achievement in a given year, the age of a student, the level of maturity, the social and psychological development, the grade level, the record of attendance and previous academic history must be considered when decisions are being made about retention or promotion. In general, the school division views retention of students as an ineffective practice, as an ineffective motivator for underachievement, and an inappropriate disciplinary measure.

Procedures

1. 	Promotion
a.	Promotion of students in Kindergarten to Grade 9 will be based on their mastery of the competencies required by the course, subject, grade or program in which they are enrolled.
