Background

Living Sky School Division recognizes the dangers faced by students with severe or anaphylactic reactions (allergies). While the Division cannot guarantee an allergen-free environment, the Division will take reasonable steps to ensure a safe environment for children with life-threatening allergies.
The responsibility for communicating concerns about students with severe or anaphylactic reactions to foods belongs to parents/guardians and to the students themselves, depending on the student’s age and maturity.
Schools have a supportive role to play in helping parents of students with severe allergies avoid exposure to pre-identified allergens while the student is at school.


Definition

Anaphylactic reactions are those severe allergy reactions that are life threatening and require immediate medical attention. An EpiPen injection will usually offer up to fifteen minutes time to transport an affected person to emergency care at a hospital.


Procedures

1.  	It is the responsibility of the principal to request that parents/guardians with anaphylactic children identify their children and encourage their children to wear an allergy alert bracelet.

2.  	Special protocols may be established in extenuating circumstances.

3.  	If parents/guardians identify their child to have severe or anaphylactic reactions to specific foods, principals shall ask other parents in that student’s class to refrain from sending those foods to school.

4.  	Regular reminders shall be sent to staff, students, and parents regarding the problematic foods.

5.  	If parents/guardians provide food for special occasions, they shall provide complete ingredient lists.

6.   	The principal shall request from the parents/guardians written information regarding the following:
  a.   The foods or other allergens which trigger an anaphylactic reaction;
  b.   A treatment protocol, signed by the child’s physician;
  c.   Permission to post and/or distribute photographs and medical information in
        key locations such as classrooms, school bus, staff room, etc.

7.   	All staff members must be made aware that a child with anaphylaxis is attending their school and that child shall be identified, either individually or at a staff meeting before or immediately after the child registers at the school.

8.   	Students shall be taught of the dangers to anaphylactic students of sharing or trading lunches.

9.   	Parents/guardians shall communicate to staff the signs of their child’s anaphylactic shock.

10. 	The staff shall be in-serviced to recognize the signs of anaphylactic shock and in the use of the EpiPen. An EpiPen is to be used only when identified in the treatment protocol for that child.

11. 	The principal shall avoid using the classroom(s) of children with food allergens as a lunchroom. If the classroom must be used for that purpose, it must be established as an “allergen-free” area or an “allergen alert” area.

12. 	The school staff shall develop strategies for monitoring “allergen-free” and/or “allergen alert” areas               and for identifying high-risk areas for anaphylactic students.
