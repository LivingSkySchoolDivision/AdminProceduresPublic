Background
Tragic events such as the loss of a member of the school community requires a thoughtful and coordinated response. School division employees will support staff, students and families who experience this loss, and will assist with connections to appropriate community and school division resources. There are several supports available within Living Sky School Division Schools including the in-house counselling team and their resources as well as outside agency support. 
Procedures
1.	Memorial Services
As places designed primarily to support learning, school sites should not serve as the main venue for the memorializing of students or staff. Although some students and/or community members have contributed greatly to the school, research confirms that vulnerable people may be inadvertently placed at risk by either “glorifying death” or by having students and staff faced with a constant reminder. On rare occasions, situations may arise in which a school site may be considered an appropriate venue for a memorial service. 
 
The following criteria should be considered when determining whether a facility request for a memorial is appropriate:

a)	Necessity - The potential number of people who wish to attend an event creates the necessity of a large gym-like space in which to hold the event. The facility booking would be treated as a special form of rental and, therefore, require reasonable attention to fire regulations.
b)	Learning - There can be no interruption of student learning. Memorial events should take place a reasonable time following school dismissal or on a weekend.
c)	Nature – A Celebration of Life - The nature of the memorial service should be that of a Celebration of Life.  Symbols of life and positive messages of hope should be major components of such services. This is a memorial event; not a funeral. Therefore, there will be no bodily remains permitted for this type of memorial.  Memorials may not be appropriate at all in certain types of situations. Each situation will be studied at the time and decisions will be made by the Director/Designate. Student participation or involvement in such services should remain limited and carefully monitored by school/division representatives.
d)	The Individual - The person being memorialized must be a member of the school community – a student, staff member or member of the learning community directly related in some manner to the school.

 
2.	Temporary/Spontaneous Memorials
a)	Temporary school memorials are generally discourages as they can inadvertently become traumatic stimuli for others, however if approved by the director or designate, a temporary memorial may be displayed for a short time (no longer than one week) and will be then offered to the family. Example of possible allowable temporary memorials are flower arrangements, banners, pictures, notes or locker displays.
b)	The school administration should regularly monitor informal memorials to ensure that there is no harmful messages or inappropriate items. Memorial items must not pose a safety concern.
c)	No memorial should be removed without the school first communicating the plan to the school community, including what will be done with the non-perishable items (i.e.: the memorial will be removed on Friday afternoon and the stuffed animals will be donated to the pediatric department of the hospital).

3.	Permanent Memorials
Best practices by the National Institute for Trauma and Loss in Children and the North American Centre for Trauma and Threat Assessment recommend the establishment of only temporary school memorials that are removed immediately after the funeral or memorial service.  

a)	Permanent memorials for deceased students and staff are limited to scholarships, and books or items with educational significance.
b)	Schools should not initiate permanent memorials such as pictures, benches, plaques or trees. If students identify a need to express their feeling of loss during the traumatic response process, school and division staff will work with them to create temporary memorials that suit the needs of students.
c)	Existing markers (limited to those accompanying the planting of trees, shrubs, perennials on school grounds) will be moved when necessary and may be permanently removed after 10 years and offered to the nearest relative.
d)	The deceased student should not receive greater mention in graduation ceremonies than would be given to any other student.
e)	Research into trauma and loss recommends that memorials should be in the community where they can be easily accessed by those who need their comfort and benefits, while also easily avoided by those who are activated by the “reminders”.

Community memorials provide the same benefits as school memorials while avoiding the many conflicts
and challenges created when erected in closed environments such as schools.

4.	Memorial Gifts or Fundraisers
Memorial gifts or fundraisers organized in a school must have the consent of the school administration. The division’s established process and procedures for fundraising should be followed. Suggested memorials include a blood drive, partnering with local non-profit organizations and related activities or establishing a scholarship. As a courtesy the family of the deceased student or staff member should also provide consent before engaging in the activity.

5.	Removal of Existing Shrines and Memorials
Current research indicates permanent memorials in schools or on school property are not advised. While a student or community member may have contributed greatly to the school, vulnerable people may inadvertently be put at risk by either glorifying death and/or having students/staff faced with a constant reminder.  

Therefore, schools are expected to work with the school community to plan to remove existing shrines in a thoughtful and respectful manner.
