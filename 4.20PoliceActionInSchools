Background

Living Sky School Division believes that schools should establish working relationships with law enforcement agencies, cooperating with the police in executing their duties in the public interest, while considering the rights and interests of individual pupils.  The Principal has responsibility for the school and is obliged to provide at least minimal assistance to police officers conducting an investigation or arresting a pupil.


Procedures

1.	Search of School Premises
a.	A peace officer may conduct a search of the school with a search warrant, or usually in the case of narcotics, a Writ of Assistance.
b.	The Principal shall accompany the officer during the search for the purpose of auditing activities, noting what is being removed from the premises, and assuring that the area is secured after the search is completed.

2.	Police Interviews with Pupils
a.	 All requests from a peace officer for interviews or interrogations with students shall be directed to the Principal or designate.  The Principal shall request that if possible, interviews be scheduled when the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) can be present.
b.	  If the parent/guardian is unavailable, a student shall have the opportunity to request that an adult of the student’s choice be present during the interview.
c.	 If the student is under eighteen years of age, the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of the student are not present, and the student requests the presence of a school official, the principal or designate should attend the interview, but should not take part in the interview other than to:
i.	ensure that the child is instructed and understands he/she has the right to remain silent,
ii.	make reasonable effort to contact the child’s parent(s) or guardian(s).
d.	In an emergency, where information is required for quick action and the child’s legal rights are unlikely to be compromised (i.e. the child is not a suspected perpetrator), it is only reasonable that an immediate interview be held.  An example of such an emergency situation would be where a child is missing and police assistance is necessary for the search.  In this case, it may be necessary for police officers to interview children thought to have knowledge of the lost child’s whereabouts.
e.	The above regulations apply to all activities taking place during regular school hours and school associated activities taking place outside of regular school hours.
f.	The aforementioned regulations do not apply in instances where students are questioned pursuant to an investigation where it is suspected that the student is in need of protection further to The Family and Child Services Act. 

3.	Arrest of Pupils
a.	A Principal or staff member should not interfere with the arrest of a student by the police.
b.	Before a student is removed from school, the Principal or designate shall request that the police officer attempt to communicate with the parent(s) or guardian(s) and inform them of the intended course of action. If parents or guardians are not available, the police will act as their duty directs.   If the police officer is unable to contact the parent(s) or guardian(s) with respect to the apprehension or removal of a student from school, the Principal or designate shall request that the police officer notify the student’s parent(s)/guardian(s) as soon as reasonably possible.   In any event, the Principal or designate shall make every reasonable effort to notify the student’s parent(s) or guardian(s) of the student’s removal from school

4.	The Principal or designate shall inform the Director of Education or Superintendent assigned to that school of any and all actions taken by a member of a law enforcement agency.
