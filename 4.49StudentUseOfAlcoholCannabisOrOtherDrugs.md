Educational programs focusing on healthy lifestyles shall be taught to students in order to discourage the use of alcohol, cannabis and other drugs. Every effort must be made to establish school environments that are alcohol, cannabis/drug free. Co-operation with families and community agencies shall be sought when students are experiencing problems related to alcohol, cannabis and other drugs.

Procedures:

1.	The school is to cooperate with parents/guardians, community agencies, and law enforcement agencies in their attempts to address problems associated with alcohol, cannabis and other drug use. Such cooperation may include, but is not limited to:
a)	Referral to drug awareness programs;
b)	Referral to various counseling agencies, services and/or personnel, or
c)	Referral or enrolment in various support or rehabilitation programs.

2.	Students who choose to disclose any alcohol or other drug related problem to a staff member will be directed to an agency or program to help them address the issue. There is a responsibility for staff members to inform the principal of the disclosure so the individual can be so directed.

3.	In the event that medically prescribed cannabis must be administered at school, the principal will ensure that Procedure 4.28 – Administration of Medications and Medical Treatment to Students is adhered to. In all cases, Form 4.28A – Administration of Medication Letter to Physician must be completed by the principal and the health care practitioner.  

4.	Notwithstanding section 3, cannabis is not to be smoked and/or ingested on school property.

5.	To safeguard the student and others with whom the student may interact, the principal will attempt to contact the parent or guardian of any student the principal has reasonable grounds to consider being under the influence of alcohol, cannabis or other drugs, and to arrange for that student to be safely removed from the premises. The student may be dealt with in accordance with Procedure 4.15 – Student Discipline and may be referred to appropriate enforcement agencies. The principal should consider an alternative to suspension, such as a substance abuse education program/component.  

6.	Any student who is in possession of, distributes, sells or supplies alcohol, cannabis or other drugs on school premises, school buses or at any school-approved activity that is listed as unlawful under any stature or regulation, may be dealt with in accordance with Procedure 4.15 – Student Discipline and referred to appropriate enforcement agencies.
