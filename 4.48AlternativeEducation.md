Background
School divisions have the responsibility to make choices that will best serve the students in their division.  Alternate Education Programs are for those students at the secondary level whose needs cannot be met through the regular education program through provincially developed, locally developed or locally modified courses of study, even after differentiated instruction has been utilized extensively at each program level.  Alternative Education Programs are developed to meet the needs of students who require curricula that are substantially different from the regular education program.   
.
Procedures
1. The decision to move a student from the regular and/or modified education program into an alternative education program should be based on:
1.1 	A comprehensive review of the student’s strengths and needs by a collaborative team using a holistic approach.  
1.2 	Assessment and evaluation of the student’s academic functioning
1.3	Assessment and evaluation of the student’s cognitive functioning as determined by a qualified personnel.  This assessment must indicate impairments for which the effects are at least moderate and prolonged and markedly limit the functioning of the conceptual domain (academic, abstract thinking, problem solving).
1.4	current and historical information, informal observations, academic performance and the students level of function across different settings.  
1.5	Informal assessments that are authentic and content-based
1.6	The agreement and input of both student and parent(s)/caregiver(s).

2. Alternate Education programs are not considered appropriate for a student 
•	with mild conceptual limitations or moderate limitations in functioning that do not directly affect academic performance or potential (ie: social limitations)
•	with specific learning disabilities
•	with inadequate educational opportunities (ie: poor attendance; behavioral considerations)
•	with a lack of proficiency in the language of academic instruction (FNMI students, Hutterian students, newcomer students, refugees and international students).

3.  Parents/caregivers and students are consulted prior to the enrolment of a student in an Alternative Education Program.  They are provided with a clear understanding of the implications and limitations of enrolling in and completing an Alternate Education Program.   That is, completion of an Alternate Education Program does not currently meet the admission requirements for most post-secondary programs.  The following information is to be provided to parents and student:
	3.1	Program goals and content
	3.2	Differences between regular, modified and alternate courses 
	3.3	Career and post-secondary implications
	3.4	Method of delivering the program
	3.5	Rationale for recommending the program

4.  A signed agreement for parents/caregivers that outlines the implications of enrolling a student in alternative education program should be placed in the student’s cumulative file.

5.  Students enrolled in an Alternate Education Program must be registered with the Registrars’ Office.  A student must be in grade 10 to be registered in an Alternate Education Program.

6. 	Students will vary in their individual program needs and in the pace at which they will be able to complete the Alternate Education Program.  Programming is expected to be flexible in facilitating a student’s completion of an Alternate Education Program.  Students may require more than one year to complete what may be considered as one year in the program. 

7. Consideration should be given to Inclusion and Intervention Plan development for students in Alternate Education on an individual basis.

8. To receive official recognition of an Alternate grade 12 program, a student must complete a minimum 	of 24 credits with at least 5 credits at the grade 12 level.

9. The credit requirements are:
	
Area of Study	Credits Required (can be a combination of Alt, Regular or Modified courses)
English Language Arts	5 credits
Math	2 credits
Science	1 credit
Social Studies	1 credit
Health/Phys Ed.	1 credit
Arts Ed/PAA	1 credit
Sub-Total	11 credits
Electives	13 credits
Total	24 credits 


10.  An Alternate Education Program may include courses from the regular program. Prerequisites that apply in the Regular Education Program also apply when those courses are used in an Alternate Education Program.

11. The Ministry of Education provides a process to facilitate a student’s request to transfer from an Alternate Education Program to a Regular Education Program.  The transfer plan can be accessed from www.edonline.sk.ca.  The following principles apply:
•	Students transferring from an Alternative Education Program to the Regular Education Program must meet credit requirements under the Core Curriculum Policy for Secondary Level completion (24 credits).
•	 Required subjects cannot be waived.
•	A course designated 18, 28, 38 cannot be used toward the completion of credit requirements for Regular Education Secondary Level.
•	The transfer plan must be approved by the Ministry of Education.
