Background

The safety of students must be assured through supervision of students in all school facilities and grounds and during school activities.  The Principal shall plan student supervision for the school day and all school-related activities, and develop procedures and practices which enhance the safety of students and recognizes the differences of individual students in terms of their safety and supervision needs.

Staff shall ensure students wear appropriate gear when they take part in an activity that presents hazardous risks, and observe safe practices particularly in those areas of instruction or curricular or extra-curricular activities that offer special hazards.

Safety instruction will precede student use of materials and equipment in units of study where there is an obvious safety concern through using either those particular materials or equipment.



Procedures

1.	School doors shall be opened at least 15 minutes prior to the commencement of morning classes or upon arrival of the first bus.

2.	School supervision of students shall begin at least 15 minutes prior to the commencement of morning classes or upon the arrival of the first bus, which ever comes first. 

3.	Noon hour, recess, before-school opening, and bus-loading supervision shall be allocated by the principal to staff on an equitable basis.  This is to take into consideration other school related activities in which staff are involved.

4.	Supervision schedules must be posted.  Posting shall be in offices and staff rooms, as well as in places where students can view and easily determine who is on duty.
