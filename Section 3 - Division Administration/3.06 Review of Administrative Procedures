Background

A regular review of administrative procedures, with opportunity for input by the appropriate stakeholders, leads to effective operations within the school system.


Procedures
 
1.	A review of all administrative procedures will be carried out by the Direction of Education or designate on a regular basis.

2.	The review of administrative procedures shall solicit input from appropriate stakeholders, as determined by the Director of Education or designate.

3.	Review of a specific administrative procedure may be initiated at any time by a formal request from the Board, a School Community Council, an administrator or a staff member who is personally affected by that procedure.  The request for such a review shall detail the issues and concerns associated with the administrative procedure and, if possible, offer suggestions for revision.  The request shall be submitted to the Direction of Education in writing.

4.	The Director shall determine an appropriate process for reviewing a specific administrative procedure when requested to ensure that fair and reasonable consideration is given to the request.  It is expected that, in most instances, such a review will be carried out by the Director, a central office administrator with direct responsibility in that area, and a school-based administrator selected by the Director.

5.	Any decisions arising from a review and renewal of administrative procedures will be communicated expeditiously to all affected stakeholders.
