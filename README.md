We have share the goals:

1. Zero Errors - we are developing tools and processes to catch errors before they are published.
2. Up-to-date - The tools will let us update the procedures in days, rather than months.
3. Machine Readable - we will publish the code in markdown format with consistent metadata
4. Easy to Use - we will publish a website where people can easily read and interact with the code.

To reach these goals we must accomplish the following general tasks:

* Create markdowns of the exisiting .doc files
* Create a transparent workflow
* Update the legacy documents and make corrections including references
* Include metadata about the documents
* Create tools to codify a statute based on the parsed statute text and extracted metadata. 
* Improve the html view of the documents 
* Create beautiful pdfs of the documents
