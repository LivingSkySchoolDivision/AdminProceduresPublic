Background

Discipline is part of the teaching-learning process. While it is recognized that students must be accountable for their behaviour, every effort must be made to teach appropriate behaviour to students.

Living Sky School Division believes that community members, parents and/or guardians, staff and students must work together to ensure that schools provide positive, orderly, safe, and nurturing environments.

Living Sky School Division is committed to the principle of natural justice and expects that interventions on behalf of students will reflect the dignity of the individual and will focus on the ability to correct undesirable behaviour, while providing opportunities for positive growth and forgiveness.


Procedures

1.	General Discipline
a.	Discipline is to stress corrective rather than punitive means.
b.	Principals and staffs are to try to determine the cause of misbehaviour and stress rectifying this cause through a variety of techniques. Where safety of others is not considered a risk, the procedures below are to be followed when behaviour problems are encountered:
i.	the teacher is to assist the student in identifying the behaviour problem, its causes and appropriate alternative behaviours
ii.	the teacher is to discuss the student’s behaviour with the principal in an attempt to generate alternative behaviour management strategies
iii.	the teacher and/or principal is to discuss the student’s behaviour with the parent(s) or guardian(s)
iv.	a consistent effort is to be made to change inappropriate behaviour through various techniques 
v.	if measures taken do not result in appropriate student behaviour the principal is to consult with the Director of Education or designate to plan for further remedial action
vi.	The goal of all behaviour management techniques used by staff is to provide a positive school climate in which the education and well-being of students are foremost considerations.

c.	Where the safety of others is at risk, temporary restraining force may be used. It must not exceed what is reasonable. Corporal punishment is not permitted.
