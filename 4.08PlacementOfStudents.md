**Background**

Living Sky School Division recognizes that students learn at different rates and that those rates can vary from year to year. Apart from academic achievement in a given year, the age of a student, the level of maturity, the social and psychological development, the grade level, the record of attendance and previous academic history must be considered when determining placement. In general, the school division views retention of students as an ineffective practice, as an ineffective motivator for underachievement, and an inappropriate disciplinary measure. The school division seeks positive, supportive responses to situations in which students have failed to learn that which they are expected to learn.

**Procedures**

1. 	Full Promotion of Students
- Full promotion of students in Kindergarten to Grade 9 will be based on their mastery of the competencies required by the course, subject, grade or program in which they are enrolled.
- Students in Grades 10, 11 and 12 will be promoted on a course by course basis. Their grade promotion will be in accordance with the credit requirements established by the Ministry of Education.

2.  Altering the Students’ Regular or Typical School Program
- Identification of concerns related to student achievement should be noted by the teacher or teachers, and made known to the principal and the parent or guardian as soon as possible.
- The decision to alter the student’s regular school program will be made following a consultative process involving the teacher, the principal, and the parent or guardian. Where appropriate, the student may be involved in the consultative process. 
- The consultative process may include the Superintendent for that school, the Superintendent of Student Services, the school student services teacher, and any other school or division personnel deemed necessary.
- The consultative process must at all times consider maximum benefit for the student. Changes to the student’s program must take into account the learning needs of the student.
- Records of all consultations and correspondence concerning changes to the student’s regular program will be kept on file at the school.
- The decision to alter the student’s regular program will be made by the principal following the consultative process. The principal shall see that any decision is communicated to the appropriate stake-holders.
