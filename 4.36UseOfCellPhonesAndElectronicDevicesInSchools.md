**Background**

Inappropriate use of cell phones, camera cell phones, and other electronic devices can interfere with the right of an individual to privacy, the studentâ€™s right to a safe and caring environment, as well as the teaching and learning process; therefore, the Living Sky School Division requires principals, in consultation with appropriate stakeholders, to formulate and implement appropriate procedures at the school site regarding the use of such devices.

**Procedures**

1.	Cell phones, camera phones, and other electronic devices will remain turned off during class time unless permitted by the principal or designate.

2.	Each school must have procedures with clear expectations and consequences regarding inappropriate use of such devices.

3.	The procedures must be published appropriately so that all stakeholders are aware.
