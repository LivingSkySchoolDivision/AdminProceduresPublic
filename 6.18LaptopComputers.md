**Background**

Teacher requests to use laptops, both division-owned and personal, for learning, teaching and committee work are growing within Living Sky School Division. Access to this technology to experiment, to learn and to become proficient users builds the confidence to teach and learn with technology. At the same time access must be managed in such a way that services to other staff members and students are not disrupted. The procedures outlined here acknowledge both the importance of access for staff and students as well as the need to protect the school division infrastructure. 


**Procedures**

1.	School division laptops issued to teachers and other school division staff
a. 	All laptops issued to staff members for school and school division committee work will be configured for maximum versatility, mobility and availability.   Staff members will be able to do the following:
i.	download application and files
ii.	use the computer at the Division Office and at any school in the division
iii.	use the laptop over the summer and other holidays

b. 	Staff members will not do the following:
i.	use ‘file sharing software’ for violation of copyright laws on the school network or by denying services to others by its activity
