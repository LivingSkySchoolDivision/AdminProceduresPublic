Background
All schools in Living Sky School Division conduct programs promoting respectful relationships and discouraging bullying.  Successful programs have at least three dimensions:

Instruction –	which models and teaches the desired behaviours.

Discipline –	practices dealing with student behaviour in relation to the 							school’s Code of Conduct that support the desired behaviours.

Data - 		some way of measuring progress in this area, for reflection and 							planning.

For the purposes of this procedure, bullying is defined as repeated harassment.  It is unwanted physical, verbal, psychological, or sexual treatment which is repeated over time.  Bullying often means that there is an imbalance of power.  Power may be on the basis of age, physical size, status or position, or ability.  This imbalance of power makes it difficult for the target to defend himself or herself.  Bullying can occur from one individual toward another, from one group of people toward one individual or from one group of people toward another group.  

Several existing procedures in Living Sky School Division provide support for these efforts.

4.13 Student Safety and Supervision
