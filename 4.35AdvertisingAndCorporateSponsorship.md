Ethical Guidelines for Business-Education Partnerships

Business-education partnerships are mutually beneficial relationships between employers and educators that are designed to enhance learning for students and other learners.  They may involve other education stakeholders as partners, including students, employees, parents, communities, labour, and government organizations. Most business-education partnerships are co-operative relationships in which partners share values, objectives, human, material or financial resources, roles and responsibilities in order to achieve desired learning outcomes.

Canadian employers and educators support business-education partnerships that:

•	Enhance the quality and relevance of education for learners
•	Mutually benefit all partners
•	Treat fairly and equitably all those served by the partnership
•	Provide opportunities for all partners to meet their shared social responsibilities toward education
•	Acknowledge and celebrate each partner’s contribution through appropriate forms of recognition
•	Are consistent with the ethics and core values of all partners
•	Are based on the clearly defined expectations of all partners
•	Are based on shared or aligned objectives that support the goals of the partner organizations
•	Allocate resources to complement and not replace public funding for education
•	Measure and evaluate partnership performance to make informed decisions that ensure continuous improvement
•	Are developed and structured in consultation with all partners
•	Recognize and respect each partner’s expertise
•	Identify clearly defined roles and responsibilities for all partners
•	Involve individual participants on a voluntary basis.
