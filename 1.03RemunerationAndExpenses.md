### Background

Living Sky School Division remunerates Board members in accordance with

election year; in other years this will take place during the budget
process, typically in March.

        the community.

    b.  It acknowledges that in serving the community personal expense
        is incurred.

    c.  It strives to ensure that remuneration levels reflect a capacity
        to enable all electors to seek a position on the Board.

2.  **Rates**

    a.  The indemnity rates and allowance rate for travel and sustenance
        are to be reviewed and set as directed by the Board at the
        organizational meeting in an election year; in other years this
        will take place during the budget process, typically in March.

        divisions in the Province of Saskatchewan.

             trustee development.

    b.  The schedule is to provide for payment such that payments are
        timely and understood clearly by the public.

    c.  One-third of the sum paid each Board member for services
        rendered is to be designated as having been paid in respect of
        general expenses incurred by the member that were necessary and
        incidental to the discharge of his or her duties.
