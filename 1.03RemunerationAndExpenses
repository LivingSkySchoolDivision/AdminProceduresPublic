### Background

Living Sky School Division remunerates Board members in accordance with
its remuneration and expense schedule. The schedule is established
annually as directed by the Board at the organizational meeting in an
election year; in other years this will take place during the budget
process, typically in March.

**Procedures**

1.  **Principles**

    a.  The Board believes that the role of trustee is one of service to
        the community.

    b.  It acknowledges that in serving the community personal expense
        is incurred.

    c.  It strives to ensure that remuneration levels reflect a capacity
        to enable all electors to seek a position on the Board.

2.  **Rates**

    a.  The indemnity rates and allowance rate for travel and sustenance
        are to be reviewed and set as directed by the Board at the
        organizational meeting in an election year; in other years this
        will take place during the budget process, typically in March.

    b.  The rates established are to be comparable to other school
        divisions in the Province of Saskatchewan.

3.  **Schedule**

    a.  The expense schedule may recognize service and expenses incurred
        in the following areas:

        i.  Attendance at Board determined meetings.

        ii. Attendance at meetings as an official representative of the
            Board.

        iii. Attendance at seminars, conventions, and meetings for
             trustee development.

    b.  The schedule is to provide for payment such that payments are
        timely and understood clearly by the public.

    c.  One-third of the sum paid each Board member for services
        rendered is to be designated as having been paid in respect of
        general expenses incurred by the member that were necessary and
        incidental to the discharge of his or her duties.

    d.  Questions arising out of the processing of Board member claims
        for payment are to be referred to the Board Chairperson.
