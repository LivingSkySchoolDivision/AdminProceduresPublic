Background

Assessment of student progress must reflect the needs of students, and be in accordance with the expectations of the Ministry of Education. Assessment of student progress must be continuous and current. It must incorporate a variety of instruments and techniques, and utilize both formal measurement and informal observation. In addition to the evaluation of knowledge and skills, the assessment should support the development of positive attitudes in the student.

In order to support the partnership between the home and the school, it is essential that student progress be reported to parents or guardians on a regular basis.
