Background

Although ensuring the safety and well-being of children is a responsibility shared by all members of the community, employees of Living Sky School Division have certain responsibilities and obligations placed upon them as a result of the nature of their tasks. Requirements concerning the welfare of children attending school are defined in The Saskatchewan Child Abuse Protocol 2014. The Division affirms that employees will be active partners with other agencies in supporting the needs of children.


Procedures

Assisting Children in Need of Protective Services:

1.	When a child reports physical, sexual or emotional abuse the receiver of the report should attempt to:       
a.	Listen openly and calmly.
b.	Reassure the child that he/she is safe and this is not his/her fault.
c.	Do not correct language and let the child report the incident in his/her own words.
d.	Document what the child has said, along with their observations of the child’s demeanour at the time of disclosure.
e.	Report (not investigate) any suspected abuse or neglect immediately to the local Ministry of Social Services or First Nations Child and Family Services Agency and/or to police and then notify the school administration.
f.	Avoid making promises that cannot be kept (ie. I won’t tell anyone. I will keep this a secret). 
g.	Do not wait until you have all of the information before calling to report the abuse.
h.	Co-operate with police and child protection workers by providing access to information and an opportunity to speak to the child as needed.
i.	Participate in case planning and observe the child’s progress, including behavior, academic progress, emotional functioning and physical well-being.
 

2.	Division employees who, through personal observation or on the basis of discussion with a child, find evidence of, or suspect possible physical, sexual or emotional abuse or neglect shall report this information to the Ministry of Social Services. The duty to report is a personal “Duty to Report” and cannot be delegated to another individual.

3.	The principal, in consultation with the person reporting the suspected abuse or neglect, shall maintain a record of all reports and evidence made concerning every incident of suspected abuse or neglect.

4.	All information, reports and discussions relative to child abuse or neglect will be treated as confidential by every person employed by the Division.

The Legal Requirement to Report to Authorities:

1.	The Child and Family Services Act requires that any Division employee who has reasonable suspicion grounds to believe that a child under the age of 16 (and in exceptional circumstances youth ages 16 and 17) is in need of protection as a result of parental abuse or neglect has the responsibility to report the information to an officer of social services or a police officer.

2.	The Emergency Protection of Victims of Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation Act requires any Division employee who has reasonable suspicion grounds to believe that a child under the age of 18 has been or is likely to be subjected to sexual abuse to report the information to an officer of social services or a police officer.

3.	The duty to report applies in spite of any claim of confidentiality or professional privilege other than solicitor/client privilege or Crown privilege.


Interviews Conducted by Officers of Social Services:

1.	Any request from an officer of social services to interview a child shall be referred to the principal.

2.	The principal (or designate) will work with the child protection worker and/or police to make the necessary arrangements for a confidential interview to occur.

3.	The child protection worker and police will determine who will be at the interview and will consider the child’s support needs and comfort level. By being present at the interview, there is a possibility that the staff member may be subpoenaed to give territory at a child protection hearing or any criminal proceedings.

4.	A written confirmation may be provided to the school by the child protection worker and/or police highlighting the meeting arrangements, acknowledging the assistance of the principal and indicating the general outcome of the investigation with respect to the child in the school setting. If written information is provided is shall be retained in school files.
